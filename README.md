# Datascience with Jupyter Notebook

This guide will help you get started with using Jupyter Notebook for data science projects, ensuring you have all the necessary tools and knowledge to explore, analyze, and visualize data effectively.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project requires Python 3.6 or newer. You can download Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Installation

1. **Install Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**: To work with `.ipynb` notebook files, you'll need Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed on your machine. You can install either of these using `pip`, Python's package manager. Open your terminal or command prompt and run one of the following commands:

    For Jupyter Notebook:
    ```
    pip install notebook
    ```

    For JupyterLab (a more feature-rich environment):
    ```
    pip install jupyterlab
    ```

2. **Install Required Libraries**: Depending on the data science libraries used in this project (like pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn), you may need to install them using `pip`. For example:
    ```
    pip install pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
    ```

    Replace `pandas matplotlib scikit-learn` with the actual libraries your project depends on.

## Starting the Jupyter Server

After installing Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, you can start the server to access and run your notebooks. Follow these steps:

1. **Launch Terminal or Command Prompt**: Navigate to the project directory where your `.ipynb` files are located or where you want to create new ones.

2. **Start Jupyter**:
    - For Jupyter Notebook, run:
        ```
        jupyter notebook
        ```
    - For JupyterLab, run:
        ```
        jupyter lab
        ```
    - Alternatively, if you encounter any issues with the above commands or if Jupyter is not recognized as a command, you can start the notebook server with:
        ```
        python -m notebook
        ```
        or
        ```
        python3 -m notebook
        ```
        This method ensures that you're explicitly using the Python interpreter to launch Jupyter, which can help avoid path and environment issues.

3. **Access Jupyter**: Your default web browser should automatically open to the Jupyter dashboard. If it doesn't, you can manually open the browser and enter the URL displayed in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:8888/` or similar).

## Using Jupyter Notebook

Once inside the Jupyter dashboard:

- **Create a New Notebook**: Click on "New" > "Python 3" to start a new notebook.
- **Open an Existing Notebook**: Navigate to and click on an `.ipynb` file to open it.
- **Run Code**: Type your Python code into a cell and press `Shift` + `Enter` to execute it. The output will appear directly below the cell.
